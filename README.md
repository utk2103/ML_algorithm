# Machine Learning EDA, Linear Regression, and Logistic Regression

This repository contains the code and resources for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Linear Regression, and Logistic Regression in Machine Learning. These are fundamental techniques used in predictive modeling and data analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The EDA directory contains notebooks and scripts for performing exploratory data analysis on datasets. EDA helps in understanding the data, identifying patterns, detecting outliers, and preparing the data for further analysis. The notebooks demonstrate various techniques such as data visualization, data cleaning, feature engineering, and statistical analysis.

## Linear Regression
The Linear Regression directory contains notebooks and scripts for implementing linear regression models. Linear regression is a supervised learning algorithm used for predicting continuous numeric values based on input features. The notebooks cover topics such as simple linear regression, multiple linear regression, model evaluation, and interpretation of results. You will find examples of implementing linear regression on various datasets and assessing the model's performance.

## Logistic Regression
The Logistic Regression directory contains notebooks and scripts for building logistic regression models. Logistic regression is a supervised learning algorithm used for binary classification problems, where the target variable has two possible outcomes. The notebooks demonstrate how to preprocess data, train logistic regression models, evaluate model performance, and interpret the results. You will find examples of logistic regression applied to different classification tasks.

## Getting Started
To get started with this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone <https://github.com/utk2103/ML_algorithm.git>`
2. Navigate to the desired directory (EDA, Linear Regression, or Logistic Regression) to access the relevant code and resources.
3. Install the required dependencies mentioned in the respective directories' README files.

   
**Dependencies**

To run the EDA code, you need to ensure that the following dependencies are installed:

Python 3

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Seaborn

You can install these dependencies using pip, with the following command:

```pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn```

5. Open the notebooks or scripts in your preferred development environment or execute them via the command line.

Feel free to explore and modify the code to suit your needs. Each directory contains its own README file with more specific instructions and additional resources.


Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions, suggestions, or feedback. Enjoy exploring the exciting world of Machine Learning!
